# Proficiently

A Claude Code plugin for AI-powered job searching, resume tailoring, and cover letter writing. Built by [Proficiently](https://proficiently.com).

> **Want someone to handle your entire job search?** Proficiently finds you jobs, tailors your resume and cover letters, applies on your behalf, and gets you in touch with hiring managers. Visit [proficiently.com](https://proficiently.com) to get started.

## Skills

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [Setup](./skills/setup/) | `/proficiently:setup` | One-time onboarding: resume, preferences, LinkedIn contacts, and work history interview |
| [Job Search](./skills/job-search/) | `/proficiently:job-search` | Automated job search with smart filtering and network matching |
| [Tailor Resume](./skills/tailor-resume/) | `/proficiently:tailor-resume` | Create tailored resumes for specific job postings |
| [Cover Letter](./skills/cover-letter/) | `/proficiently:cover-letter` | Write natural, persuasive cover letters |
| [Network Scan](./skills/network-scan/) | `/proficiently:network-scan` | Scan your contacts' companies for matching job openings |

## How They Work Together

1. **`/proficiently:setup`** uploads your resume, configures preferences, imports LinkedIn contacts, and conducts a work history interview (one-time)
2. **`/proficiently:job-search`** finds jobs that match your preferences and resume, flags companies where you have connections
3. **`/proficiently:tailor-resume`** rewrites your resume for a specific job posting, saves the job posting and tailored resume together
4. **`/proficiently:cover-letter last`** writes a cover letter using the most recent job's posting and tailored resume
5. **`/proficiently:network-scan`** scans your LinkedIn contacts' companies for matching openings (leverages your network for warm intros)

All skills share a `~/.proficiently/` directory for personal files. Each job application gets its own folder containing the posting, tailored resume, and cover letter.
